4,1,1,1,6,5,I prefer the more experienced doctor,62,1,12/15/22 8:40,12/15/22 8:43,,221
4,1,1,1,4,6,Because it is a correct answer from the passage,34,0,12/15/22 8:36,12/15/22 8:43,,451
4,1,1,1,6,5,I prefer someone with more years of experience that will rely on his own experience when he doesn't agree with technology.,57,0,12/15/22 8:37,12/15/22 8:43,,388
4,1,1,1,5,6,I prefer an older doctor,30,1,12/15/22 8:37,12/15/22 8:44,,384
4,1,1,0,4,6,I think they are more up to date with newest testing and advancements in medicine.,39,1,12/15/22 8:38,12/15/22 8:44,,315
4,1,1,0,6,6,I think that the younger doctor probably has more familiarity working with the algorithm.,43,0,12/15/22 8:39,12/15/22 8:44,,285
4,1,1,0,5,5,Genetic Testing and AI assistance are relatively new technologies. The younger Dr having graduated more recently may have more current training and knowledge regarding the newer technologies.,38,1,12/15/22 8:39,12/15/22 8:44,,288
4,1,1,0,4,4,"I actually would be fine with either, but forced to choose, I generalized that a younger person may be better with technology.",37,1,12/15/22 8:40,12/15/22 8:44,,199
4,1,1,0,5,5,A younger doctor might be better adept at working with AI.,30,1,12/15/22 8:40,12/15/22 8:44,,260
4,1,1,1,6,3,I'd rather have the older doctor. They have more experience.,61,0,12/15/22 8:39,12/15/22 8:44,,300
4,1,1,1,6,6,They seem to have more experience which I would slightly prefer if I had to choose between the two.,37,1,12/15/22 8:39,12/15/22 8:45,,320
4,1,1,0,6,5,To me its a matter of preference. The only difference between the two is age but its more than that. I felt like the older person wouldn't be able to use the ai as easily. I jsut felt the younger person would be more hip to using it.,37,1,12/15/22 8:37,12/15/22 8:45,,518
4,1,1,1,6,4,More experience. I have no other information to decide with. I assume more experiences means more cases and more accuracy. The AI had nothing to do with my decision. One doctor has been doing it longer. That is the only differentiating thing I could find.,42,1,12/15/22 8:41,12/15/22 8:46,,246
4,1,1,0,4,4,I would feel more comfortable with a doctor around my own age in this situation.,37,1,12/15/22 8:39,12/15/22 8:46,,382
4,1,1,0,3,6,Everyone is expecting the older person to have the problems. It is better to catch it in the younger person so that it can be solved so that they can get old,28,1,12/15/22 8:41,12/15/22 8:46,,278
4,1,1,1,6,4,Generally speaking I would choose the doctor with more experience.,45,1,12/15/22 8:42,12/15/22 8:46,,241
4,1,1,1,4,3,I would be weary about the AI and would want to choose an older doctor who has experience before the new age of technology and AI. I would feel more confident in a doctor who is older with more experience before AI.,26,0,12/15/22 8:40,12/15/22 8:46,,372
4,1,1,1,6,5,I think that the 61-year-old doctor will have more experience.,41,1,12/15/22 8:42,12/15/22 8:46,,237
4,1,1,0,5,5,It depends on the  age and experience matters. Then how they handle the AI.,26,1,12/15/22 8:40,12/15/22 8:46,,403

4,1,1,0,5,5,I think since they recently graduated and they are younger they could have a better chance o relating to patients. Also can use technology more efficiently cause of age.,37,0,12/15/22 8:42,12/15/22 8:48,,391
4,1,1,1,3,6,I trust it will be more effective.,31,1,12/15/22 8:41,12/15/22 8:48,,423

4,1,1,1,6,4,I would prefer the experienced doctor over the more novice one.,27,1,12/15/22 8:42,12/15/22 8:49,,395
4,1,1,0,5,5,Closer to my age,39,1,12/15/22 8:38,12/15/22 8:49,,664
4,1,1,0,3,5,I don't want a old doctor that doesn't know as much about new technology. I want someone younger that is more up to date with medical procedures.,43,0,12/15/22 8:44,12/15/22 8:50,,358
4,1,1,1,6,4,I would prefer the doctor with more experience so I chose the older one.,47,1,12/15/22 8:46,12/15/22 8:50,,250
4,1,1,1,7,6,More years of experience and worked longer,34,0,12/15/22 8:44,12/15/22 8:50,,339

4,1,1,1,6,5,The doctor had much more experience and I would feel more comfortable with them.,36,1,12/15/22 8:49,12/15/22 8:55,,319
