# MedicalAI-NLP-Analysis
A small repository where I'll put the code for the NLP Analysis (for BED Lab). The analysis was done using Open AI's Davinci-003 model. The philosophy is that I've processed each entry of qualitative data through their Natural Language Processing models. This output data was then used in a variety of statistical tests.
>Correlation test pending...

>Refinements to code and additional analysis pending...

## NOTE:
>The bulk of analysis has been done in 'analysis_Candidate.py'
>>

>Folder include sample dataframes (I removed any identifiable information).
>>'aiExplanation.csv' dataframe holds AI responses. Recorded and saved for easier access to view any imprecision.

>Usage requires you to generate an OpenAI API authorization key. 
>>Paste just the key in a '.txt' file named 'OpenAIKey.txt' and place it in the folder labeled 'OpenAI Work.'
